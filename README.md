Running title: The clinical pattern of microbiome in human blood

# Abstract
The microbiome, often referred to as the second genome of humans, plays a pivotal role in maintaining health. The mechanisms through which the microbiome influences human blood are not yet fully understood. In our study, we utilized Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to thoroughly investigate the presence and prevalence of the microbiome. Our findings revealed the existence of four distinct patterns of blood microbiome. Notably, certain microbiomes were identified as conditional pathogens and prominent in group 2. This particular group exhibited correlations with clinical characteristics indicative of relatively unhealthy conditions. Conversely, group 3 displayed higher shannon diversity, suggesting a more robust ability to resist changes in the human environment. To delve into the regulatory relationships between human genetics and blood microbiome, we conducted genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) to establish a connection between specific genetic factors and the composition of the blood microbiome. Furthermore, we developed a risk index for the microbiome, allowing us to stratify the population into high and low risk groups. Inhouse data and published cohorts, the use of the median score as a threshold consistently demonstrated the ability to categorize individuals based on their microbiome associated health risk. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the microbiome present in human blood, along with the derived risk score, serves as a reflective indicator of the overall health status in natural populations. These insights contributed to our understanding of the intricate relationship between the microbiome and human health.
